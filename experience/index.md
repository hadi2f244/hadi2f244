Designed and evolved automated testing for infrastructure code; introduced maturity assessments, deployment reliability metrics, and standardization of Ansible role quality gates.

## Automation & Testing
Implemented Molecule/Testinfra pipelines enabling fast feedback on infrastructure changes, reducing production regressions.

## Delivery & Observability
Integrated structured logging, tracing, and metrics into pipeline stages to expose bottlenecks and failure points.
