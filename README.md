## Professional Summary
DevOps & Platform Engineer focused on elevating tooling maturity, enforcing testability of infrastructure (Ansible + Molecule/Testinfra), and improving deployment reliability through observable, measurable delivery pipelines. Known for transforming fragmented automation into governed, repeatable frameworks that reduce defects and cycle time.

## Core Competencies
- DevOps Tooling Maturity Assessment & Roadmapping
- Infrastructure Test Automation (idempotence, convergence, security, compliance)
- CI/CD Pipeline Engineering & Telemetry (lead time, failure rate, recovery)
- Ansible Role Quality Gates & Standards
- Infrastructure as Code Governance (lint, policy, review workflows)
- Observability Integration (metrics, logs, traces in pipeline stages)
- Reliability Engineering Mindset (measurable outcomes, feedback loops)

## Technical Skills
**Primary:** Ansible, Molecule, Testinfra, GitHub Actions, Git, Shell scripting, Linux systems, Infrastructure testing patterns
**Secondary:** Terraform (foundations), Prometheus/Grafana concepts, Python (automation scripts), OpenTelemetry basics
**Improving:** Advanced Terraform modules, SRE error budgets & SLIs/SLOs evolution, Policy as Code (OPA / Conftest)

## Selected Experience (CV Extract)
| Area | Impact |
|------|--------|
| Tooling Maturity Framework | Introduced structured evaluation → reduced tool sprawl & clarified ownership. |
| Ansible Testing Harness | Standardized Molecule/Testinfra baseline → lowered deployment regressions. |
| Pipeline Reliability Dashboard | Added telemetry → faster incident recovery & higher deploy confidence. |
| Infrastructure Quality Gates | Enforced lint/security scans → improved consistency and compliance. |

## Medium Publications
1. Ten Maturity Principles of DevOps Tooling – strategic lenses for platform evolution.
2. Ansible Code Testing – Part 2 – Writing Tests – practical validation patterns.
3. Ansible Code Testing – Part 1 – Test Environment Automation – foundational setup.

## Approach & Philosophy
I optimize for: reliability, repeatability, transparency in flow metrics, pre-production validation, and sustainable evolution over ad‑hoc automation. I favor lightweight governance that accelerates safe delivery rather than slowing engineers down.
